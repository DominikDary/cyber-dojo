Issue: javascript has dot files appearing at the top of the file-list.
Would be nice to have just the source files appearing in the top section.
Idea: Use filename_extension (from manifest) to select files appearing in top section.
Problem: C/C++ have more than one filename extension.
Solution? extend filename_extension in the manifest so it can be an array of strings.
Make kata.filename_extension (in models) return an array.

C/C++ have specific makefiles which controls specific extensions.
Viz they are .cpp and not .C

So for C
[ ".c", ".h" ]

And for C++
[ ".cpp", ".hpp" ]

DONE.
