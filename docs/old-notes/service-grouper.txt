...It would be nice to decouple the runner from the avatar abstraction...
(and also, make it easier to select different avatars)

Suppose there was a service called 'grouper'
Its job would be to group individual participants into a group.
Or to record that a practice-session (PS) was for an individual.
The storer would know absolutely nothing about individual/group
or avatars. The storer would simply record increments against the ID.
The grouper would, I think, also need to record the choice
of "icons" for the group. Eg "animals". If new icon lists are introduced
it should not (necessarily) change the appearance of existing icons.
The grouper would also need to record the index of the icon (in its list)
for each participant in a group PS.
Eg if the first animal in is randomly selected to be lion, and the lion
is the 23rd animal in its list, then the first animals index is 23.
There is an assumption here that I won't change the icon set for an existing PS.

So, suppose there was a practice session (PS) with id 456

-- I join 456 and the grouper assigns me a
   new uid 789 and associates it with 456

-- I can ask the grouper for my parent-group,
   passing it 789 and it
   tells me 456,3
   because I am the third participant in 456

How will this play out with the avatar-name?
If grouper assigns indexes incrementally then how
will the avatar names be random?
The grouper could simple store a shuffled array of [0..64]
It still allocates internal indexes incrementally, but
if the index is 3 it gives me back shuffle[3]

My "identity" which was previously {456,lion} is now 789

This is the id which is used by the system, for me.

There is a new service called 'avatarer' (need a better name)
Its for group sessions only.
Your id is 789. From the grouper you get {456,3}
You give 3 to the avatarer and it gives you back {lion}

This lion is used for group display only.
Note that there is really 2 items of information
"lion" and the image. They are coupled.

Inside the system, there is uniqueness for 789.

This opens up the ability to have individual "portfolios"
which are simply collections of ids. "lion" is simply a
UI thing.


Note that there is a coupling to nginx too, since it has to hold
the images for the named avatars.

Could this work 'retrospectively'?
What about all the information stored in storer?
I think there is nothing inside the json files.
I think the avatars are only in the folder/ names.
So I think this could be done on-the-fly

Backward compatibility - reverse lookup
=======================================

Some URLs include avatar names....
eg
http://www.cyber-dojo.org/kata/edit/JXYASC17PD?avatar=toucan

I would need to trap those, perhaps in an error handler
and reroute to the new, simpler, URL, eg
http://www.cyber-dojo.org/kata/edit/vX4DQqhwvx

This means I will need reverse lookup...

I need avatarer to convert "toucan" -> 4
I need grouper to do children("JXYASC17PD") -> [cid0,cid1,cid2,cid3,cid4,...]
Then I find the cid by using index 4 in this array => cid4

What about going from the cid alone to the gid?
That feels like something that would be better stored in the storer...
But that feels wrong since it introduces coupling.
Better for the grouper to store this info too..

It has folders for _all_ IDs.
If an ID is a group id the folder will store a children.json file
If an ID is a child id the folder will store a parent.json file
Raises the possibility of Composite, where it will store both.

One effect of creating a flat ID structure in the storer could be
there will be to no longer have easily collected caches of the increments.
I think a better design is to have explicit cachers for the dashboard
and differ, and to simplify the data stored in storer as much as possible.

Grouper API
-----------

create_group_ps(icons,manifest) -> gid
  - icons = name of the icon-list, eg "animals", what you look like
  - manifest = information currently in storer. storer really does become just increments.
               maybe rename to that? storer was always too general, too vague
  - maybe this could be the full list, eg ["antelope","bat",...]
  - how does that play with changes, eg in the number of avatars
  - for example, we went from 16 to 64 before...
  - how does the grouper create the id? needs to be unique in storer...
    no it doesn't. Its not held in the storer at all. Stores only holds "actual" IDs.
    grouper's job is to map from its group ID to the storer-IDs
    So gid has to be unique in the grouper. The child IDs it records will be
    IDs in the storer.

create_alone_ps(manifest) -> aid
  - what about a lone PS?
  - IS this is the same as a group PS limited to one "entrant"?
  - I think it is.

join(gid) --> {cid,index}
  - gid = PS group-id
  - cid = PS child-id
  - index = random (but consistent) index of cid in gid

children(gid) --> [{cid,index},{cid,index},{cid,index},{cid,index}]
  - gid = PS group-id
  - cid = PS child-id,
  - where the index of cid in the array is not relevant



So one effect of the storer is to increase "security".
The UX display will be in terms of gid,aid and icons.
But the grouper will map these to storer IDs (sid)s.
So the sids will never be "revealed".
This affects backward compatibility.
How are current URls going to be affected?
