Provides dashboard view.

The dashboard refreshes every 10 seconds...

The vast majority of the time it shows very few new traffic lights.
It's pretty fast because of the structure of the files on the SSD drive.
eg increments.json

Could caching speed this up?

How about if each test event result was sent not only to the storer but
also to the cacher...

The cacher could keep in memory copies on the most-recent N practice-sessions
holding _all_ their avatar and traffic-light info.
I'd need a recently used list!

What else could do with caching?
Only really the diff view I think.
That could be cached too...
Again plan to hold a full cache of the most recent N practice-sessions
This means the test info, the source files (as well as the result)
needs to be sent to the cacher.
The cacher then has a choice of whether to cache the file-sets
and create the diffs on demand, or to diff the file-sets and
cache the diffs. Later is faster...
