Make storer id-completion methods part of a separate helper class.

incoming partial_id is always 6 chars.
if it completes to 10 chars its for an old base16 ID
if it completes to 6 chars its for a new base58 ID

Dont like this because at the moment there are always 10 digits.
Better if I can keep it to always 10 digits.
So keep 10 digits. But put directory structure barrier at 6 digits.
Yes. This is much better. Keeps the format of URLs.

So, incoming partial_id is always 6 chars.
It always completes to 10 digits on success.
But, this completion will have to work with two different dir structures.
New-structure: b8/LYDy/Jt3C
  this is a glob like this
      Dir.glob("b8/LYDy/*") and it must have 1 completion
      exact structure to be determined based on speed tests,
      eg could be (would prefer it to be)
      Dir.glob("b8/LY/Dy/*")
Old-structure: 12/34567890
  this is a glob like this
      Dir.glob("12/3456*") and it must have 1 completion
