I would like to move the katas/ out of its data-container and into
a regular host directory (which can be NFS mounted).
This will be important for k8s I think.

Perhaps the simplest way to get them out, which does not worry about upgrade
of format at all, is to simply to tar pipe them out into a tgz file.
Then cp the tgz file into a dir that has been bind-mounted to a persistent disk.
This should be doable on the storer VM which is 37% full, 47% inode-full

See scripts/tar_katas_out.bash

Then untar this into the dir that has been bind-mounted to a persistent disk, eg /persistent-disk
See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk

tar -C /persistent-disk -xvf backup.tar.gz

This will create
/persistent-disk/usr/src/cyber-dojo/katas/...

Then, storer will need to volume mount that dir to the dir it uses internally...

In a docker-compose.yml file...

BECOMES...
  storer:
    volumes:
      - /persistent-disk/usr/src/cyber-dojo/katas:/usr/src/cyber-dojo/katas:rw

WAS...
  storer:
    volumes_from:
      - container:${CYBER_DOJO_KATAS_DATA_CONTAINER}:rw

Note that the storer container runs as the storer user (19661) so
you will also need...

$ chown -R 19661:19661 /persistent-disk
