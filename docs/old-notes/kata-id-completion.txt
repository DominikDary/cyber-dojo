Make storer id-completion methods part of a separate helper class.

incoming partial_id is always 6 digits.
It always completes to 10 digits to keep the format of URLs.
But put a new directory structure barrier at 6 digits.

The completion will have to work with two different dir structures.
New-structure: b8/LYDy/Jt3C
  this is a glob like this
      Dir.glob("b8/LYDy/*") and it must have 1 completion
      exact structure to be determined based on speed tests,
      eg could be (would prefer it to be)
      Dir.glob("b8/LY/Dy/*")
Old-structure: 12/34567890
  this is a glob like this
      Dir.glob("12/3456*") and it must have 1 completion

Now, there is a still a problem that storer does not know
whether the 10 digit ID is in the old-dir structure
or the new-dir structure. All I can think here is that
it tries the new-dir structure first, and if that exists
it uses that, if not it drops back to the old structure.



Also want to collapse the duplication between Storer and StorerFake.
Have an inner StorerCommon class that accepts its PfA externals.
Storer delegates to StorerCommon with the real externals.
StorerFake delegates to StorerCommon with fake externals.
